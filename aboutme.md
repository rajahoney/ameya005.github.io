I am Ameya Joshi, Sr. Computer Scientist at [Sigtuple Tech](https://sigtuple.com). I work as a Computer Vision Engineer/ Data Scientist/ <em>resident Geek</em>. My primary research interests are <em>Deep learning for medical image analysis</em> and <em>Semantic Segmentation using Weak Labelling</em>. I have also been looking at Generative Neural Networks. 


### My History

I graduated with a B.E.(Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, in 2014 from BITS Pilani. Then I worked at [Ducere Technologies](https://lechal.com) as a Computer Vision Engineer. This was followed by an intense and amazing year at [Tonbo Imaging](https://tonboimaging.com); working on thermal camera systems for the Indian Armed Forces. Currently, I am following my passions at [Sigtuple Tech](https://sigtuple.com); building intelligent medical systems for diagnostic screening.
