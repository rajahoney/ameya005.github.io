Dr. Fei Fei Li from Stanford discusses the advent and growth of computer vision in recent years. Particularly intersting is her recent research on multimodal interactions and large scale visual recognition. This has been primarily made possible due to the growth in GPU technology. I hope to try out Theano and Caffe for deep learning in this scenario soon.
