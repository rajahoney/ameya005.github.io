It's been ages since I last posted here. But it is time to reboot this blog.

Since, i have always been all about computer vision, and my current job involves using the 'deep' and 'wide' now to solve medical imaging problems, here I am back to talk about deep learning, recent advances in computer vision and my trysts with it.

So, this being a quick update post, I will keep it short... but do await the new series of posts on me tangling with the latest and greatest of computer vision research.
