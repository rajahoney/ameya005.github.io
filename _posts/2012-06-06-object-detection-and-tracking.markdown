Couple of days ago, I was shown this video by one of my friends.

This video actually is the pretty close to my final aim of constructingÂ  a system which allows people to use natural interactions to work with a computer. So, I decided to recreate and improve this using OpenCV and OpenGL. Since, I am inexperienced at the graphics portion of the program, I decided to take the help of my friend, Siddharth who is currently working with OpenGL. I will be posting updates on this project shortly and in order.
